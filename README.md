# Exploring Long Tail Visual Relationship Recognition with Large Vocabulary

## Abstract
Several approaches have been proposed in recent literature to alleviate the long-tail problem, mainly in object classification tasks. In this paper, we make the first large-scale study concerning the task of Long-Tail Visual Relationship Recognition (LTVRR). LTVRR aims at improving the learning of structured visual relationships that come from the long-tail (e.g., rabbit grazing on grass). In this setup, the subject, relation, and object classes each follow a long-tail distribution. To begin our study and make a future benchmark for the community, we introduce two LTVRR-related benchmarks, dubbed VG8K-LT and GQA-LT, built upon the widely used Visual Genome and GQA datasets. We use these benchmarks to study the performance of several state-of-the-art long-tail models on the LTVRR setup. Lastly, we propose a visiolinguistic hubless (VilHub) loss and a Mixup augmentation technique adapted to LTVRR setup, dubbed as RelMix. Both VilHub and RelMix can be easily integrated on top of existing models and despite being simple, our results show that they can remarkably improve the performance, especially on tail classes.

This is a PyTorch implementation for [Exploring Long Tail Visual Relationship Recognition with Large Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00436). Paper is accepted for ICCV 2021.

This code is for the GQA-LT and VG8K-LT datasets.

We borrowed the framework from [Detectron.pytorch](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/Detectron.pytorch) and [Large-scale Visual Relationship Understanding](https://github.com/jz462/Large-Scale-VRD.pytorch) for this project, so there are a lot overlaps between these two and ours.

## Evaluating Pre-trained Relationship Detection models

DO NOT CHANGE anything in the provided config files(configs/xx/xxxx.yaml) even if you want to test with less or more than 8 GPUs. Use the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to control how many and which GPUs to use. Remove the
`--multi-gpu-test` for single-gpu inference.

### GQA
**NOTE:** May require at least 64GB RAM to evaluate on the GQA test set

We use three evaluation metrics:
1. Per-class accuracy (sbj, obj, rel)
1. Overall accuracy (sbj, obj, rel)
1. Overall triplet accuracy
1. Accuracy over frequency bands (many, medium, few, and all) using exact matching
1. Accuracy over frequency bands (many, medium, few, and all) using synset matching
1. Average word similarity between GT and detection for \[word2vec_gn, word2vec_vg, lch, wup, lin, path, res, jcn] similarities

## Training Relationship Detection Models

The section provides the command-line arguments to train our relationship detection models given the pre-trained object detection models described above.

DO NOT CHANGE variable `NUM_GPUS` in the provided config files(configs/xx/xxxx.yaml) even if you want to train with less or more than 8 GPUs. Use the environment variable `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to control how many and which GPUs to use.

With the following command lines, the training results (models and logs) should be in `$ROOT/Outputs/xxx/` where `xxx` is the .yaml file name used in the command without the ".yaml" extension. If you want to test with your trained models, simply run the test commands described above by setting `--load_ckpt` as the path of your trained models.


### GQA
To train our relationship network using a VGG16 backbone with the ViL-Hubless loss, run
```
python tools/train_net_step_rel.py --dataset gvqa --cfg configs/gvqa/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_gvqa_y_loss_only_hubness100k.yaml --nw 8 --use_tfboard --seed 0
```

To train our relationship network using a VGG16 backbone without the ViL-Hubless loss, run
```
python tools/train_net_step_rel.py --dataset gvqa --cfg configs/gvqa/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_gvqa_y_loss_only_baseline.yaml --nw 8 --use_tfboard --seed 0
```

To train our relationship network using a VGG16 backbone with the RelMix augmentation, run

```

To run models with different ViL-Hubless scales create a new config file under `configs/gvqa/` (by copying the file `configs/gvqa/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_gvqa_y_loss_only_hubness.yaml`) and change the variable `TRAIN.HUBNESS_SCALE` to the desired value.
Also confirm the ViL-Hubless loss is activated by making sure the variable `TRAIN.HUBNESS` is set to `True`

```
python tools/train_net_step_rel.py --dataset vg8k --cfg configs/vg8k/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_vg8k_y_loss_only_hubness100k.yaml --nw 8 --use_tfboard --seed 3
```

To train our relationship network using a VGG16 backbone without the ViL-Hubless loss, run
```
python tools/train_net_step_rel.py --dataset vg8k --cfg configs/vg8k/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_vg8k_y_loss_only_baseline.yaml --nw 8 --use_tfboard --seed 3

```

To run models with different ViL-Hubless scales create a new config file under `configs/vg8k/` (by copying the file `configs/vg8k/e2e_relcnn_VGG16_8_epochs_vg8k_y_loss_only_hubness.yaml`) and change the variable `TRAIN.HUBNESS_SCALE` to the desired value.
Also confirm the ViL-Hubless loss is activated by making sure the variable `TRAIN.HUBNESS` is set to `True`
